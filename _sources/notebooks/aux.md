# Auxiliary functions and classes

The **teareduce** package defines several classes and functions that facilitate
reduction work. In particular, they simplify the Python code to be written and
help preventing some common errors when handling data array indices.

- [The imshow wrapper](aux/imshow/imshow)
- [Auxiliary classes for image slicing](aux/sliceregion/sliceregion)
- [Elapsed time and system information](aux/elapsedtime/elapsedtime)
